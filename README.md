# Hi, I'm Morgan! 👋

I'm a data analytics student with a growing interest in how data, marketing, and user behavior intersect. I love using analytics to understand what drives people, whether that's the music they listen to or the brands they connect with.

Right now, I'm working on a **music data analytics dashboard** using public Spotify API data. The project explores trends in genre preferences, audio features, and listener behavior, with a focus on how insights like these can support marketing strategies, audience segmentation, and creative campaign decisions.

I'm passionate about blending:
- 🎧 **Music + Entertainment Data**
- 📈 **Marketing Analytics & Consumer Insights**
- 💼 **Finance & Sales Data Analytics**
- 🤖 **Machine Learning & Data Storytelling**

Always excited to build projects that combine creativity with data-driven thinking.


🌱 Always learning, especially around ML, analytics, AI, and real-world applications of data.
